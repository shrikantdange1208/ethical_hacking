</head><body>NMAP - A network mapping tool.<br/>
<br/>
Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing. It uses raw IP packets to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services those hosts are offering, what operating systems they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
1. Looks for open ports.<br/>
2. Can run on TCP side or UDP side<br/>
3. By default it runs stealth scan (-sS). <br/>
4. -sU for UDP scan<br/>
<br/>
Sample Command:<br/>
nmap -A -T4 -p- 10.10.10.4<br/>
<br/>
Command to find reported vulnerabilities:<br/>
<b>nmap -Pn -p445 --script vuln 10.10.10.4</b><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A = All (Look for everything - OS Detection, Version Detection, script scanning, traceroute)<br/>
T4 = speed (0 - 5)<br/>
-p- = All ports (1 - 65535)<br/>
<br/>
nmap --help<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Things to find out:<br/>
1. Nmap is not stealthy anymore. How is it picked up? What happens when it is picked up?<br/>
