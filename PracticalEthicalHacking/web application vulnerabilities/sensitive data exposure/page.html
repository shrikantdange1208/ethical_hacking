</head><body>Check Response Headers - They tell u what kind of Protections are there<br/>
One of the Defense is HSTS - Http Strict Transport Security <br/>
Should be set in order to prevent an attack where we take secure data say https, we strip it, called <b>Protocol Downgrade Attack (Man in the middle attack)</b>&nbsp;and we make it http. This unencrypts the data.<br/>
<br/>
Use securityheaders.com to analyze what protections are present for a website.<br/>
<br/>
Look at level of encryption on a website:<br/>
nmap -script=ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 tesla.com<br/>
